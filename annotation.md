DEXTR is an AI-powered tool that is available to you from the start. It works by you placing four markers (or more) - one on the most northern edge of what you want to label, and one on the most eastern, northern, and western edges too. It is a powerful tool that can get you really good results in just four clicks.
DEXTR requires a minimum of four markers to function. When your mouse pointer is over one of these edges, left-click or press "A" to create these markings. The DEXTR-model will "look" for any object inside of those four markers after you have provided four markers. 
You can keep adding points if you're unsatisfied with the choice. You should be aware, though, that occasionally, the outcomes might not be the best. In our experience, adding more over 10 frequently results in subpar performance, even for complicated objects. 
By left-clicking, holding, and dragging markers to the correct location, you can move them.
You can remove the marker you placed last by pressing "backspace". You can also select a marker that you want to delete by first clicking on it and then pressing "backspace"
Tolerance 
When DEXTR has been activated, you will be able to see a "Threshold" in the top left corner. This threshold can be set from 0-100% by you, the user. It controls how strict the model should be when generating results. The higher the threshold, the smaller and more precise the result will be.
Reset the tool 
If you are unhappy with your selection and want to start over, you can press “esc”.
Convert to object 
When you are satisfied with your selection you can turn it into an object by pressing “enter”, or by clicking the “convert” button in the tool settings toolbar.
DEXTR might take a couple of minutes to activate the first time you annotate as well as when you open up a project where no one has been annotating for the last 30 minutes.
